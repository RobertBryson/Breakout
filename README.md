Fixed compiler error - Circular dependency caused by include "PowerupFireBall.h" in "PowerupBase.h", removed include as was unused - \*1 minute

Added mouse controls - New function "followMouse()" in Paddle. Player is given choice, which is stored as bool and passed to game manager, in update calls appropriate control scheme - \*20 minutes

Parameterised powerUpChance - added variable used for rand() that decides when power up spawns - \*2 minutes

Screen Shake - On lost life sets shake bool to true, this is checked in update along with other parameters such as intervals, and length, to shake the components of the scene - \*25 minutes
